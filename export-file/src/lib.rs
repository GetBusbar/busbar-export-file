//! The **request-log FILE sink** (`module: request-log-file`, PUSH): each request-log batch the host
//! builds for this instance is appended to a JSONL file.
//!
//! A `kind: export` plugin on the export kind's memory ABI (`busbar_contract::abi::export`, THE
//! DESIGN §11): ONE door ([`door`], `plugin_door!`), linked into the binary as a compiled-in row or
//! exported by the sibling `busbar-export-file-plugin` cdylib as its one symbol. Its manifest still
//! carries [`DECLARES`] (`busbar-plugin-pack --declares-file declares.json`): the three series, the
//! five catalogue codes and the one destination.
//!
//! **The sink never opens a path.** Its manifest declares `path` a DESTINATION: the host binds the
//! operator's configured path, and every append and every rotation is a host act on the host's
//! bounded disk lane (THE DESIGN §11.11 R4, the `disk.append` service of §11.12): a delivery hands
//! the batch, unchanged, to `disk.append` under the key `path`, and the host appends it whole —
//! rotating the file by rename first when it already holds `rotate_mb` MiB. What the host reports
//! back is raised in the words the sink always raised: an append the host could not make drops the
//! batch with the open-failed ([`OPEN_FAILED`]) or append-failed ([`APPEND_FAILED`]) line, and each
//! failed step of a rotation with its own declared code.
//!
//! Settings are validated by the sink itself while the host validates the configuration, with the
//! same serde shape ([`config::FileSettings`]) and so the same words.
