//! **busbar-export-file** — the built-in PUSH per-request JSONL file exporter (Logs stream), as a busbar `kind: export` sink (COLD/JSON ABI lane).
//!
//! This is the DISTRIBUTION half of the `request-log-file` observability sink, promoted out of
//! busbar-core's compiled-in `export::file` module into a real, both-ways export-kind plugin
//! (busbar 1.6.0 DECISIONS #3 / #30 / #11). All the sink logic lives here in this rlib; the sibling
//! `busbar-export-file-plugin` cdylib is only the ABI adapter.
//!
//! ## SCAFFOLD STATUS
//!
//! This is a COMPILING SKELETON. [`open`] returns a clear `unimplemented` error and no real sink
//! logic has been copied in yet — the byte-identical extraction from busbar-core is a separate,
//! oracle-gated step (the sink's on-wire output — the /metrics exposition, the OTLP request, the
//! webhook payload, the JSONL line — is a money/behavior byte-identity surface and must move under
//! an oracle, not by hand).
